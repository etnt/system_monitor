# Consumer - Producer extension
> Output monitor data over a Websocket

This extension to the `system_monitor` application makes
it possible to send the collected info via the `system_monitor_producer`
code over a websocket to a Consumer. If the Consumer is setup
to be the `system_monitor_consumer` it will send along the incoming
data to the `system_monitor_pg` Postgres handler.

So basically, it can be used in two ways, either by inserting
a "bridge" (via the websocket) to the `system_monitor` Postgres
backend, or simply used as a way to output the data over a websocket
to any other backend that is capable of consuming the incoming data.


## Setup the Consumer

The Consumer is the "backend" that receives the data, produced
at the target node, over the Websocket. It is on the backend Host
that we run Postgres in docker container and Grafana in another
docker container. These docker containers can be setup by running:

```shell
$ make dev-start

# The check that they have been created:
$ sudo docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES                                                                                
d5432f939bb9   docker-grafana         "/run.sh"                17 minutes ago   Created                               docker-grafana-1                                                                     
9b31895dea71   docker-db              "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   17 minutes ago   Created                               docker-db-1

# To start them:
sudo docker start docker-db-1
sudo docker start docker-grafana-1
```

To create the necessary server- and client certificates we will make use
of the [myca](https://github.com/etnt/myca) package. 

```shell
# Clone a shallow copy of the 'myca' package and enter the subdir.
$ make CA
$ cd CA
# Create CA- and Server certificate; prompted for some info.
$ make all
# Create Client certificate; prompted for some info.
$ make client
```

Prepare a tar file of certificates to put at the Client:

```shell
$ tar cvzf ~/sysmon_client_bill.tgz client_keys/bill@acme.com_Tue-21-Nov-2023-01\:14\:32-PM-CET.pem certs/cacert.pem 
client_keys/bill@acme.com_Tue-21-Nov-2023-01:14:32-PM-CET.pem
certs/cacert.pem
```

By default the Consumer-Producer functionality is turned off.
The configuration is available but disabled in the
`src/system_monitor.app.src` file where it also is documented.

To enable and configure the functionality we need to modify the
`system_monitor.app` file that has been generated during compilation.
This can either be done manually by hand or by making use of the
`setup_consumer_producer`script. This script takes, as argument,
the file path leading to the `system_monitor.app` file which will
be modified inline. It looks for any corresponding environment
variables and, when found, makes the changes.

The setup of the environment variables and invoking the
script can be done as show below:

```shell
$ set -a
$ . ./config/consumer.env
$ set +a
$ ./script/setup_consumer_producer -c ./_build/default/lib/system_monitor/ebin/system_monitor.app
```
> __Note:__ if using `rebar3 shell`, which will recompile the application,
> it can be necessary to operate on the `./src/system_monitor.app.src`
> file instead to avoid overwriting the `system_monitor.app` file.

To tailor the resulting app file for either the Consumer or the Producer,
use either of the `-c` or `-p` flags to the script.

A copy of the old file will be saved as a backup.

The content of the `.env` files can look like this:

```shell
$ cat ./config/consumer.env
CONSUMER_ENABLE=true
CONSUMER_LISTEN_IP=0.0.0.0
CONSUMER_LISTEN_PORT=8888
CONSUMER_USE_TLS=true
CONSUMER_CACERTFILE="/home/system_monitor/CA/certs/cacert.pem"
CONSUMER_CERTFILE="/home/system_monitor/CA/certs/server.crt"
CONSUMER_KEYFILE="/home/system_monitor/CA/certs/server.key"
CONSUMER_CRLDIR="/home/system_monitor/CA/crl"
```


## Setup the Producer (the client at the target node)

Start by installing the client certificates we put in the tar file.

```shell
$ mkdir certs
$ tar xvzf ~/junk/sysmon_client_rune.tgz
client_keys/rune@kruskakli.com_Tue-21-Nov-2023-01:14:32-PM-CET.pem
certs/cacert.pem
```

Then modify the `producer.env` file to fit:

```shell
$ cat ./config/producer.env
PRODUCER_ENABLE=true
PRODUCER_IP=192.168.1.172
PRODUCER_PORT=8888
PRODUCER_USE_TLS=true
PRODUCER_CACERTFILE="/home/system_monitor/certs/certs/cacert.pem"
PRODUCER_CERTFILE="/home/system_monitor/certs/client_keys/bill@acme.com_Mon-Nov-20-09:46:10-UTC-2023.pem"
```

Then give the .app file some massage: 

```shell
$ set -a
$ . ./config/producer.env
$ set +a
$ ./script/setup_consumer_producer -p ./_build/default/lib/system_monitor/ebin/system_monitor.app
```


## Running


Start the Consumer node as:

```shell
$ make consumer
```

At the target node where the Producer will run, start like:

```shell
$ make producer
```

If setup properly, the Producer will setup a websocket to the
Consumer and start sending the collected data.
